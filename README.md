# Ski-Jumping

This is a main exercise taken from MOOC Object Oriented Programming With Java course.

Jumpers earn points as they attempt to land as far as possible down the hill. 

First the simulator asks for jumpers name, these are stored and the simulator starts when the user enters an empty string.

The jumpers jump in the order of the jumper with the least points to the one with the most points.

The points for each jumper are decided by 5 judges, this score is taken from the jump length and the judgeâ€™s vote on the jump.
The score only takes 3 of these scores into consideration - The smallest and largest are not added to the total score.

The user can then choose to either jump again or to end the tournament, when ended the results are shown with the jumper
with the highest score showing first.
